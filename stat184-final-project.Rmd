Front Matter:
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(DataComputing)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```



Data Access:

```{r}
primarymath <- read_csv("student-mat.csv")
head(primarymath)

primarypor <- read_csv("student-por.csv")
head(primarypor)

secondary <- read_csv("StudentsPerformance.csv")
head(secondary)
```

Data Wrangling:

```{r}
# Add variable that specifies what subject
primarymath$subject <- "math"
primarypor$subject <- "portuguese"

# Combine the two dataframes into one
primarymerged <- 
  rbind(primarymath ,primarypor)

# Renaming observations to prepare for join
 primarymerged$Medu[primarymerged$Medu==c("0")] <- "some high school"
 primarymerged$Medu[primarymerged$Medu==c("1")] <- "some high school"
 primarymerged$Medu[primarymerged$Medu==c("2")] <- "some high school"
 primarymerged$Medu[primarymerged$Medu=="3"] <- "high school"
 primarymerged$Medu[primarymerged$Medu==c("4")] <- "higher education"
 
 primarymerged$Fedu[primarymerged$Fedu==c("0")] <- "some high school"
 primarymerged$Fedu[primarymerged$Fedu==c("1")] <- "some high school"
 primarymerged$Fedu[primarymerged$Fedu==c("2")] <- "some high school"
 primarymerged$Fedu[primarymerged$Fedu=="3"] <- "high school"
 primarymerged$Fedu[primarymerged$Fedu==c("4")] <- "higher education"

 secondary$`parental level of education`[secondary$`parental level of education`=="some college"] <- "higher education"
 secondary$`parental level of education`[secondary$`parental level of education`=="associate's degree"] <- "higher education"
 secondary$`parental level of education`[secondary$`parental level of education`=="bachelor's degree"] <- "higher education"
 secondary$`parental level of education`[secondary$`parental level of education`=="master's degree"] <- "higher education"
 
 
```

```{r}
#Finding average scores for each level of parental education
