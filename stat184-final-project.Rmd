Research Question: How do the family lives of high school students effect their socializing/drinking habits, and in turn their success and interest in school?

Data Access:

```{r}
math_table <- read_csv("student-mat.csv")
head(math_table)

por_table <- read_csv("student-por.csv")
head(por_table)

```

Data Wrangling:

```{r}
# Add variable that specifies what subject
math_table$subject <- "math"
por_table$subject <- "portuguese"

# Combine the two dataframes into one
joined <- 
  full_join(math_table ,por_table)

```

```{r}
# Finding the highest level of parent education
joined <-
joined %>%
  mutate(parentedu = ifelse(Medu>Fedu, Medu, Fedu))


```

```{r}
# Calculate overall grade and average weekly alcohol consumption level
joined <-
joined %>%
  mutate(grade = (G1+G2+G3)/3,
         avgalc = ((Dalc*5)+(Walc*2))/7) 

# Round overall grade and average weekly alcohol consumption level
joined <-
joined %>%
  mutate(avgalc = round(avgalc),
         grade = round(grade))
```

```{r}
# Create levels of "high" or "low" alcohol consumption
joined <-
joined %>%
  mutate(avgalc = gsub("1", "low", avgalc),
         avgalc = gsub("2", "low", avgalc),
         avgalc = gsub("3", "low", avgalc),
         avgalc = gsub("4", "high", avgalc),
         avgalc = gsub("5", "high", avgalc))

#

```

```{r}
# Select variables to be used in analysis
GlyphReady <-
joined %>%
  select(school, sex, age, address, famsize, Pstatus, famsup, famrel, subject, grade, avgalc, parentedu)
```

```{r}
# Make machine learning model
model <- lm(grade ~ avgalc + parentedu + famrel + famsup, data = GlyphReady)

summary(model)
```
